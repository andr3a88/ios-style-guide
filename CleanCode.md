## Cleand Code

Writing clean code is what you must do in order to call yourself a professional. There is no reasonable excuse for doing anything less than your best.

#### We Are Authors

The _@author_ field of a Javadoc tells us who we are. We are authors. And one thing about authors is that they have readers. Indeed, authors are responsible for communicating well
with their readers. The next time you write a line of code, remember you are an author, writing for readers who will judge your effort.

#### Naming

It is easy to say that names should reveal intent. What we want to impress upon you is that we are serious about this. **Choosing good names takes time but saves more than it takes.**

#### Comments

```
“Don’t comment bad code—rewrite it.”
—Brian W. Kernighan and P. J. Plaugher
```
